Macro for generating FOSS integration tests for rules_codechecker.

Each foss_test() generates a local py_test that:
  1. Downloads a FOSS project into a temp directory
  2. Sets up a standalone Bazel project with rules_codechecker
  3. Runs "bazel build" on codechecker targets to verify the rules work
  4. Validates the outputs (compile_commands.json, codechecker artifacts)

Example:
    foss_test(
        name = "zlib",
        url = "https://github.com/madler/zlib/archive/<commit>.tar.gz",
        tests = [":codechecker_test", ":compile_commands"],
    )
"""
